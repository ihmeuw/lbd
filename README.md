# HIV Prevalence - Africa - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of HIV prevalence and the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) among adults ages 15-59 years in sub-Saharan Africa for year 2000-2018, discretized by sex for 5-year age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, ..., 55-59), as well as aggregated across sex and age for all adults ages 15-59 years and 15-49 years.

This repo contains two directories:

1) lbd_core contains general code for model based geostatistics used across Local Burden of Disease projects at IHME. 
2) lbd_hiv contains code that is specific to estimating HIV prevalence and PLHIV.
