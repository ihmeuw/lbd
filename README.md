# Onchocerciasis prevalence - Africa and Yemen - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of onchocerciasis prevalence among all ages and both sexes, combined.

The repo contains two directories:
1) lbd_core/mbg_central - containing model-based geostatistical code similar to code used across multiple projects at IHME
2) lbd_oncho - containing code specific to data cleaning and modeling for the onchocerciasis prevalence analysis
