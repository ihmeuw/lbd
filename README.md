# HIV - Latin America - 2020

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of HIV mortality and deaths due to HIV by age group (0-4, 5–9, 10–14, …, 75–79, and ≥80 years) and sex at the municipality level in six countries in Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador. This code was part of the manuscript, Mapping subnational HIV mortality in six Latin American countries with incomplete vital registration systems, in BMC Medicine.

This repo contains two directories:

1) lbd_core contains general code for model based geostatistics and small area estimation used across Local Burden of Disease projects at IHME. 
2) lbd_hiv contains code that is specific to estimating HIV mortality and deaths due to HIV.
