# MCV1 - LMICs - 2020
This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing-vaccine (MCV1) coverage among in low and middle income countries (LMICs) as reported in _Mapping routine measles vaccination in low- and middle-income countries_ published in Nature.

This repo contains two directories:
1.    lbd_core contains general code for model based geostatistics used across Local Burden of Disease projects at IHME.
2.    vaccine contains code that is specific to data processing and estimating vaccination coverage.
