# Summary     :
# This script will determine how many cores are available for R which has been
# compiled against Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) in a qsub job on IHME's
# compute cluster. This script will honor resource requests as either slots
# ("NSLOTS") or threads ("fthread") and attempts to set the appropriate values
# for environmental variables controlling both OpenMP (OMP_NUM_THREADS) and the
# MKL (MKL_NUM_THREADS) so as not to oversubscribe the node or use more cores
# than was granted for the job.
# 
# After the determination of the number of total cores to use, a container is
# launched from the latest Singularity image found in the "image_dir"
# (unless a specific image is given), the version of R in the image is launched,
# and the specified R script is executed.
#
# It is assumed that this script is launched by an R script (such as
# 'parallelize' or 'make_qsub_share' found in
# 'lbd_core/mbg_central/misc_functions.R') as a qsub job.
#
# This following information is used in this script:
#   * host               : lbd (lbd-cluster-p*) node or prod node (cluster2,
#                          intel, or AMD) as determined from $host value.
#   * NSLOTS             : number of slots requested with the job set by UGE.
#   * SGE_HGR_fthread    : The specific number of threads requested for the job
#                          set by UGE.
#   * SGE_HGR_m_mem_free : The max amount of memory requested for the job set by
#                          UGE. We don't do anything with this except echo it
#                          for the user if it is set.
#   * PE                 : Parallel environment environmental set by UGE. If
#                        : is set to "multi_slot" the "NSLOTS" is used to
#                          determine maximum cores available for the job,
#                          otherwise "SGE_HGR_fthread" is used. 
#   * sing_image         : The Singularity image to launch a container from
#                          containing the R MKL version. Default is to located
#                          the latest image found in "image_dir" with the
#                          "get_latest_image()" function
#   * SET_OMP_THREADS    : Number of threads allowed for packages with OpenMP
#                          parallel regions (user defined [default=1])
#   * SET_MKL_THREADS    : Number of threads allowed for packages linked against
#                          Intel's MKL (user defined
#                          [default=${max_threads} calculated by script])
#   * JOB_NAME           : Job name passed to UGE with qsub
#   * JOB_ID             : Job ID passed to UGE with qsub
#   * /proc/cpuinfo      : Used to find the total number of processors on the
#                          host machine in order to calculate cores/slot
#   * qstat              : Used to grep out total number of slots the machine
#                          has been partitioned into in order to calculate
#                          cores/slot
#   * singularity        : This command must be present in order to spin up a
#                          container
#
# Details:
# This script first determines what node it is has landed on (host machine)
# after a `qsub` to execute the R script. It then makes a determination if the
# number of cores allocated to the job is given by "SGE_HGR_fthread" or by 
# "NSLOTS". In the past, all jobs were given a number of slots. As of October
# 29th, 2018, a portion of the cluster began to schedule jobs enforcing that
# both "fthread" (setting the "SGE_HGR_fthread" environmental variable) and
# "m_mem_free" (setting the "SGE_HGR_m_mem_free" environmental variable) be
# specified instead. Since a portion of the cluster still will use "NSLOTS" and
# another users "fthread"/"m_mem_free" over a period of several months, this 
# script supports both types of resource requests in the following way:
#
# fthread/m_mem_free:
# If the script finds that the "SGE_HGR_fthread" and "SGE_HGR_m_mem_free"
# environmental variables are not empty, the "NSLOTS" environmental variable is
# 1, and the "PE" environmental variable does not equal "multi_slot", then the
# value of "SGE_HGR_fthread" is used as the maximum cores (${max_threads})
# allowed for the job. The value of maximum memory from "SGE_HGR_m_mem_free" is
# echoed for the user.
#
# Slots:
# If the script finds that the "PE" environmental variable is "multi_slot" and
# the "NSLOTS" environmental variable is not empty, it will use slots to
# ultimately determine the maximum number of cores allowed for the job. It first
# determines the number of total cores on the machine and total slots allocated
# to the machine so it can calculate the cores/slot ratio. It then determines
# how many slots have been allocated to the job ($NSLOTS) and, using the
# cores/slot ratio, calculates how many cores it actually has to use
# in the calculation ${max_threads}. Most machines have a cores/slot ratio = 1,
# but there are some machines which do not, making the above necessary.
# Further some types of machines (the AMD's) can have a variable number of slots
# they have been partitioned into (51, 64, or 100), giving a variable cores/slot
# ratio. Since ${max_threads} may not be an integer, this script takes some care
# not to aggressively round up the number of cores based on the number slots
# requested and potentially oversubscribe the machine.
#
# After ${max_threads} is determined by either "NSLOTS" or "SGE_HGR_fthread",
# the user settings for SET_OMP_THREADS and SET_MKL_THREADS (if any) are
# considered to determine how to set OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS
# following suggestions from Intel here:
# https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/recommended-settings-for-calling-
# intel-mkl-routines-from-multi-threaded-applications
# R with the MKL works best when both OMP_NUM_THREADS as well as MKL_NUM_THREADS
# are set in such as way as to not oversubscribe the machine. In the event that
# both OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS are both unset, the MKL will grab all
# available cores on the machine. This is probably undesired behavior on a
# shared cluster node. Since most R functions are not SMP parallel the default
# for this script is to set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 and
# MKL_NUM_THREADS=${max_threads}. There are some packages (like TMB and INLA)
# which itself have OpenMP parallel regions and each parallel region may also
# make use of the MKL. In such a case, it may make sense for the user to define
# how many threads they wish to set for TMB (with OMP_NUM_THREADS, such as the
# number of physical slots on the machine for example), and a separate number of
# MKL threads (with MKL_NUM_THREADS) which each OpenMP parallel region will
# launch.
#
# Below shows the different configurations that may be set by the user:
#
# Scenario  | User Setting           | Result Set by This Script
# ----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
# A         | SET_OMP_THREADS unset  | OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
# [default] | SET_MKL_THREADS unset  | MKL_NUM_THREADS={max_threads}
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# B         | SET_OMP_THREADS=N      | OMP_NUM_THREADS=N (N <= {max_threads})
#           | SET_MKL_THREADS unset  | MKL_NUM_THREADS={max_threads}/N
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# C         | SET_OMP_THREADS unset  | OMP_NUM_THREADS={max_threads}/M
#           | SET_MKL_THREADS=M      | MKL_NUM_THREADS=M (M <= {max_threads})
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# D         | SET_OMP_THREADS=N      | OMP_NUM_THREADS=N
#           | SET_MKL_THREADS=M      | MKL_NUM_THREADS=M
#
# Note that in scenarios A, B, and C, the script goes to the trouble to check
# the machine is not using more cores than have been allocated for the job. In
# all three of these scenarios, the user may not oversubscribe the machine, i.e.
# use more than ${max_threads}. In scenario D, the assumption is that since the
# user is explicitly setting both the SET_OMP_THREADS and SET_MKL_THREADS this
# is for good reason, and the user may oversubscribe the node with a warning.
#
# After a determination is made for SET_OMP_THREADS and SET_MKL_THREADS, these
# values are used to set OMP_NUM_THREADS and MKL_NUM_THREADS.
#
# The script then gives the user some details about the host node, the job, and
# the Singularity image it is making use of.
#
# Finally, the script will launch a Singularity container from a user provided
# image location or, if the 'default' keyword is given, from the latest image
# found by the "get_latest_image()" function in the "image_dir" directory.
#
# This script is dependent on being launched through qsub where UGE sets the
# $JOB_NAME, $JOB_ID, and $NSLOTS variables, and optionally the $PE,
# $SGE_HGR_fthread, $SGE_HGR_m_mem_free variables.
#
# This script is also dependent on the upstream R script that launches it to
# pass the ${sing_image} variable (qsub -v sing_image=...) with either the full
# path to the Singularity image to launch a container from or the 'default'
# keyword indicating to use the most current image. Optionally, the
# SET_OMP_THREADS and SET_MKL_THREADS values may be passed with the '-v' option
# in the qsub as well.
